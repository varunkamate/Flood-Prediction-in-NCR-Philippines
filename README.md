#🌊 Flood-Prediction-in-NCR-Philippines

This project is all about predicting flood risks in the NCR region of the Philippines using real-world weather and environmental data. 🚨 Flooding is one of the most common natural disasters in the country, and being able to predict it early can save lives, reduce damage, and help in planning disaster response more effectively.

I worked on this dataset (Flood_Prediction_NCR_Philippines.csv) and applied multiple machine learning algorithms to build predictive models. The notebook (Flood_Prediction_NCR_Philippines_4_algo.ipynb) shows a step-by-step workflow of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

✔️ Key Highlights of the Project:

Explored and cleaned raw flood-related data.

Tried out 4 different ML algorithms for comparison.

Saved the trained model (model.pkl) for easy deployment.

Evaluated model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Insights that can support disaster preparedness and early warning systems.

📌 This project is not just about coding – it’s about solving a real-world problem using data science and machine learning.

If you’re interested in disaster prediction, climate-related data analysis, or ML applications in environmental studies, you’ll definitely find this useful. 🌍✨
